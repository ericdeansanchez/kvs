-- just for fun -- :)

following [PNA](https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan/blob/master/rust/projects/project-1/project.md)

will also be committing directly to master until it makes sense to
have more structured commits (_if_ it ever does make sense).

i will be using the following code bases as references:
* [cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo)
* [clap](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo)
* [serde](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde)
* [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)

i will also be doing some things here that i want/wanted to try out
in [bifrost](https://github.com/ericdeansanchez/bifrost).


let's get into it
